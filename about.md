The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative's Infrastructure Advisory Committee (DCMI-IAC) formed in the fall of 2015 to evaluate DCMI's web infrastructure and plan for the future. The committee seeks to develop sustainable solutions for the long term creation and maintenance of DCMI's web content. The committee holds bi-weekly calls on Fridays.
