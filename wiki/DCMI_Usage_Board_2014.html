<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="DCMI_Usage_Board"> DCMI Usage Board </span>
</h2>
<p>The Usage Board serves as DCMI's decision-making body
on technical specifications to which DCMI, as an
organization, makes a long-term maintenance commitment.
This commitment is a statement to the general public of
an intent to maintain a core set of high-priority
assets as living specifications, subject to periodic
review on the basis of published principles.
</p>
<p>This maintenace commitment builds on and extends the DCMI
Persistence Policy [1], by which the organization
pledges to keep its documents available on the Web,
with change histories, for as long as it is able, and
to offer them to future hosts in the event that DCMI is
disbanded.
</p>
<p>The commitment applies first and foremost
to DCMI Metadata Terms [2]: to its machine- and
human-readable manifestions, to international standards
based on the Terms, to mappings to related vocabularies,
and to the Namespace Policy [3] that specifies the
policies and principles governing changes or extensions to
DCMI-branded vocabularies generally.
</p>
<p>Agreements with other vocabulary maintainers, such as
the Agreement between DCMI and the FOAF Project [4], also
fall under the remit of the Usage Board.
</p>
<p>Resources permitting, the Usage Board may extend its
scope to other technical specifications subject to the
procedures set out in the Usage Board's Process Manual,
the relevant sections of the DCMI Bylaws (as revised
from time-to-time), and the oversight of the Governing
Board.
