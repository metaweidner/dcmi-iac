</p>
<p>DC-2013 International Conference, Lisbon, Portugal
</p>
<p><b>Organizers</b>:  Marcia Zeng, Maja Zumer, Joseph Busch
</p>
<p><b>Attendees</b>: Marcia Zeng, Maja Zumer, Joseph Busch, Neubert Joachim, Makx Dekkers  
</p>
<p>Update on the progress made so far. (PPT given by Marcia included the data model, attributes and metadata elements, relationship vocabulary, and KOS types vocabulary). 
</p>
<p>Brief discussion on each part (see appendix for each part). 
</p>
<p>Focuses of the discussions ended with the following results:
</p>
<p>1. We have registered a namespace
<a href="http://purl.org/nkos" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://purl.org/nkos</a>  At the moment it just point to our NKOS website but we will have a place for the declared nkos terms soon. 
</p>
<p>2. We will have these terms to declare (if follow DCMI's namespace pattern):
five nkos elements (proposed as <a href="http://pur.org/nkos/terms/xxx" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://pur.org/nkos/terms/xxx</a>
about 15 nkosType terms (proposed as <a href="http://pur.org/nkos/nkostype/xxx" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://pur.org/nkos/nkostype/xxx</a>)
</p>
<p>3. Based on the discussion with Tom Baker, we will first make the vocabulary available, i.e., those terms listed above. DCMI will host the documents.
</p>
<p>4. We would enter into the second stage of the NKOS Task Group to develop application profiles. 
Makx gave some great suggestions that we may have:
</p>
<p>(1) DCterms-based AP for Linked Data use by nkos registries, and 
</p>
<p>(2) a DC-based one for those registries who have not got into Linked Data efforts.  
</p>
<p>5. We may extend to have one for schema.org-based for those who want to use in microdata and rdfa, and harvesters/aggregators. This is a new goal, not quite sure if everyone agree with these newer goals.  As RDFa/RDFa lite  is supported by Google etc., we should target on this instead of microdata. 
</p>
<p>6. After the meeting, Joachim will extend the RDF description of STW Thesaurus for Economics using some of the nkos AP terms. 
</p>
<p><b>Background:</b>
</p>
<p>The DCMI/NKOS Task Groupâ€™s overriding goal is to establish an Application Profile for describing the KOS Resources (NKOS-AP)[1]. Through the workshops at DC-2010 and DC-2011 and around a paper presented in DC 2012, the Task Group members have been actively involved in the development of the NKOS-AP. Currently the outcome of the Task Group include: NKOS Users and Use cases[2], Domain Model, Core Elements in the context of user tasks,  NKOS AP Entity Relationships, and NKOS Attributes and Metadata Elements (with the mapping to DCMI terms and proposed elements)[3]. A wiki site [4] documents all of these results as well as an example explaining the attributes [5].
