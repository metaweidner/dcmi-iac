<p>CSC is developing and maintaining national data model for the Finnish academia in the field of higher education and science. The use case for machine-readable application profiles would be to support the development of application profiles and the whole lifecycle of metadata: 
</p>
<p>1. Development of application profiles using “semantic templates” which documents the vocabulary for both human and machine. Mix&amp;Match classes and properties from appropriate vocabularies. Create extensions to existing application profiles, for example CEN <a href="http://www.cen-ltso.net/main.aspx?put=1042" class="external text" rel="nofollow">MLO</a>.
</p>
<p>2. Validate the proper use of “semantic templates” (Ensure good quality of the profile)
</p>
<p>3. Provide provenance information about lifecycle of the development process
</p>
<p>4. Validate the instances against the developed application profile (Validation of Data)
</p>
