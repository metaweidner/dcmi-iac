<p>The following text is taken directly from documentation on ISO liaison organization relationships and the issues such organizations must consider.  In defining a more formal structure with regard to communications (inward facing &amp; outward facing) of DCMI liaisons can benefit from some of the notions/observations in this text.</p>

</h2>
<p>This section provides principles and guidance to enable liaison organizations to assess their level of interest in approved new work items and approved new fields of activity in ISO.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Principles"> Principles </span>
</h3>
<ol>
<li> For new ISO projects, the proposer of the initiative shall indicate the range of organizations/stakeholder groups supporting the initiative, as well as those that, according to their interests and identified needs should as a minimum be involved in its development in order to facilitate the arrangements of national consensus building.
</li>
<li> Liaison organizations should be committed to informing and seeking input from a broad range of their relevant stakeholders on any new ISO projects once they are approved by the ISO member bodies.
</li>
<li> All relevant stakeholders should be given equal access to information and equal opportunity to provide input.
</li>
<li> Liaison organizations should be committed to basing decisions on their level of involvement in the ISO activity on consideration of the collected input from relevant stakeholders.
</li>
<li> Information on new ISO projects should be provided to the liaison organization’s stakeholders in a timely manner and at the earliest appropriate opportunity to allow all relevant stakeholders to access the information, determine their interest in it and provide input effectively by any deadlines.
</li>
<li> Liaison organizations should make provision for a range of approaches to support timely and effective stakeholder engagement and participation based on the needs of the stakeholders.
</li>
<li> Comments submitted by liaison organization should reflect consensus agreement rather than a compilation of all comments expressed within the liaison organization. Submittal of redundant or even contradictory comments should be avoided.
</li>
</ol>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Guidance"> Guidance </span>
</h3>
<p>To assist in achieving these principles, the following guidance may be helpful:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Liaison organizations should conduct a consultation with all relevant stakeholders. This could take place via a step-wise approach such as:
<ul>
<li> Identification of potential stakeholders
</li>
<li> Providing stakeholders with information on the approved project
</li>
<li> Identifying those stakeholders willing to participate in the ISO work on an ongoing basis
</li>
<li> Once relevant stakeholders have been engaged in the process and have contributed views, based on the input received, the liaison organization should assess its support for, and its level of participation interest in, approved new work items and approved new fields of activity in ISO.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> There are many ways of engaging with the relevant stakeholders, both proactively and passively. For example, if your organization has a Website, details of the approved project should be placed on the site and a more targeted identification can be made via notices in relevant publications, on-line news items to stimulate discussion, and through already established sectors within liaison organizations. Furthermore, active outreach and communications to identified stakeholders should be pursued. Stakeholders in need of funding to support their participation should seek out sources of such funding.
</li>
</ol>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stakeholder_engagement_and_consensus_decision_making_on_ISO_work"> Stakeholder engagement and consensus decision making on ISO work </span>
</h2>
<p>This section provides principles and guidance to support the efforts by liaison organizations related to stakeholder engagement and consensus decision-making in the development of consensus comments on ISO work on an ongoing basis.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Principles_2"> Principles </span>
</h3>
<ol>
<li> The approach by which a liaison organization determines its consensus comments is the decision of the liaison organization.
</li>
<li> Liaison organizations should establish an appropriate process to develop consensus comments on ISO work, as well as to determine the liaison organizations’ representation at ISO meetings. It is recommended that internal mirror committees (IMCs) are formed whenever possible, but some liaison organizations may determine their consensus comments by other means. Some liaisons may already have an internal committee in a field where new international projects are started and the liaison should use these existing structures in its participation in ISO work.
</li>
<li> Differences in approaches may be based on differing operational models, dynamics or available resources. Regardless of the specific approach used, what is vital is that the development of the consensus comments is informed by and responsive to the input collected from the relevant stakeholders.
</li>
<li> A description of how the liaison organization determines its consensus comments should be publicly available to all its stakeholders or made available to them upon request.
</li>
<li> It is the responsibility of the liaison organization to arrive at consensus comments that reflect and reconcile the views of the range of its stakeholders that have a legitimate interest in the ISO subject.
</li>
<li> Decisions on the comments of liaison organizations should be taken based on the consensus principle, and such decisions should carefully consider the balance of interests across the input collected from relevant stakeholders.
</li>
<li> All relevant stakeholders should have equal access to participation in the liaison organization’s process for development of positions, and all stakeholders formally engaged in the liaison organization’s process should be assured of fair and equitable treatment and consideration in that process.
</li>
<li> When consensus is reached among stakeholders within the liaison organization on technical content issues on the ISO work, it is expected that the liaison organization will submit the stakeholder consensus position and technical comments to ISO in accordance with its established procedures. It is recognized that on occasion a liaison organization may need to make editorial revisions for political or legal reasons.
</li>
<li> Comments submitted by the liaison organization should reflect consensus agreement rather than a compilation of all comments expressed at the organizational level. Submittal of redundant or even contradictory comments should be avoided.
</li>
<li> When consensus is reached within a liaison organization on comments on ISO work, all relevant stakeholders should respect and support those consensus comments within ISO activities and at ISO meetings, and they should not express views within the ISO activity that may limit the success of the consensus comments.
</li>
<li> Where consensus cannot be reached and a fundamental objection cannot be overcome, it is important that the liaison organization have a procedure for dispute resolution or appeals.
</li>
<li> A description of how the stakeholder engagement will be conducted by the liaison organization should be communicated to ISO.
</li>
<li> ISO committees and their leaders, NSBs and liaison organizations and their delegates and experts should respect the consensus positions and comments submitted by NSBs and liaisons.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Liaison organizations should periodically assess their processes and procedures for stakeholder engagement and consensus decision making on ISO work, and
seek to continually improve them as necessary.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Guidance_2"> Guidance </span>
</h3>
<p>To assist in achieving these principles, the following guidance may be helpful:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Consensus is defined in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1 as : “ General agreement, characterized by the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues by any important part of the concerned interests and by a process that involves seeking to take into account the views of all parties concerned and to reconcile any conflicting arguments. Consensus need not imply unanimity.”
</li>
<li> When consensus on comments has been established, it is good practice for the liaison organization to communicate these consensus comments to all relevant stakeholders that have been engaged in its development.
</li>
<li> Liaison organizations have an obligation to address and make an effort to resolve all views expressed.
</li>
<li> Liaison organizations may organize meetings, teleconferences or Web-based discussions to assist in the development of consensus comments.  All relevant stakeholders should have an equal opportunity to participate.
</li>
<li> Achievement of consensus entails recognizing the wider interest and sometimes making certain compromises. Arguments for and against the existence of an ISO project should be pursued at the stage where the project proposal is considered and action  is taken on it. However, once an ISO project has been approved, all liaison organizations and their stakeholders involved in the process should be committed to advancing the global relevance of International Standard(s) within the agreed-upon scope, and they should not seek to hinder its further development. Where a liaison organization sustains a fundamental objection and supports it with sound arguments, these concerns will be taken seriously.
</li>
</ol>
