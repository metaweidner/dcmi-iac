<p><strong>Webinar Date:</strong> Wednesday, <strike>17 June 2015</strike> 9 September 2015, 10:00am-11:15am EDT (UTC 14:00) World Clock: <a href="http://bit.ly/webinar-keiser" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/webinar-keiser</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Opening up and linking data is becoming a priority for many data producers because of institutional requirements, or to consume data in newer applications, or simply to keep pace with current development. Since 2014, this priority has gaining momentum with the Global Open Data in Agriculture and Nutrition initiative (GODAN). However, typical small and medium-size institutions have to deal with constrained resources, which often hamper their possibilities for making their data publicly available. This webinar will be of interest to any institution seeking ways to publish and curate data in the Linked Data World.</p>
<p>Keizer and Caracciolo will provide an overview of bottlenecks that institutions typically face when entering the world of open and linked data, and will provide recommendations on how to proceed. They will also discuss the use of standard and linked vocabularies to produce linked data, especially in the area of agriculture. They will describe AGRISAs, a web-based resource linking agricultural datasets as an example of linked data application resulting from the collaboration of small institutions. They will also mention  AgriDrupal, a Drupal distribution that supports the production and consumption of linked datasets.</p>
