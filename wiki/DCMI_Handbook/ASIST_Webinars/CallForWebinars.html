<p>DCMI CALL FOR WEBINARS -- 2016-2017
</p>
<p>As part of its mission, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is committed to providing high quality education and training in metadata modelling, implementation and best practice. To fullfil this mission, DCMI hosts an ongoing international series of monthly webinars that regularly attract large audiences. The topics covered by the DCMI webinar series range from the theoretical to the practical and from expert overviews to targeted guidance. All webinars are designed to achieve specific learning outcomes and to meet the needs of metadata developers and implementers from novice users to professional experts.
</p>
<p>DCMI is actively seeking innovative individuals and experts to propose topics and presentations for inclusion in the highly regarded DCMI/ASIST Webinar Series. Topics can cover any aspect of metadata modelling, implementation and practice, or highlight innovative new developments and work in progress. 
</p>
<p>While the majority of webinars will be offered in English, DCMI is very interested in spreading the word in other languages. Therefore, the base languages for DCMI webinars are <b>English</b>, <b>Spanish</b> and <b>Chinese (Mandarin)</b>. Webinars in other languages may be considered in a case by case scenario. 
</p>
<p>DCMI webinar presentations normally run for 50-60 minutes followed by 15-20 minutes of Q&amp;A. Proposals are reviewed by the DCMI Education &amp; Outreach Committee who selects webinar topics based on the requirements of DCMI users, developers and implementers.
