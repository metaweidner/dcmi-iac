<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="General_Budgeting_Principle"> General Budgeting Principle </span>
</h2>
<p>Throughout its fiscal year, DCMI has historically maintained an operating budget surplus calculated as the difference between its total income and its total expenditures.  DCMI strives to achieve a modest annual operating budget surplus which it carries over as prudent reserve into the budget cycle for the next fiscal year.  Remuneration for members of the Directorate is set by the Oversight Committee.  Such remuneration is established for renewable periods not to exceed six months and are subject to adjustment (scale-back) in order to maintain an operating budget surplus for the fiscal year.  Thus, DCMI's variable expenses are closely tied to income streams and adjusted according to circumstances.  Maintenance of an operating budget surplus is the responsibility of the Directorate with ongoing oversight by the Oversight Committee.  
</p>
<p>Budgetary planning is the responsibility of the Managing Director in consultation with the Oversight Committee. The projected annual budget is based on prudent estimates of DCMI income and necessary expenses during the fiscal year.  The budget is reviewed quarterly and, when necessary, revised to maintain an operating budget surplus.
