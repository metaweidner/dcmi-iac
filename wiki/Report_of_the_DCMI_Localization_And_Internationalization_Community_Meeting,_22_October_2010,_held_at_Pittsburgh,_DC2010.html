<p>Chair: Karen Rollitt
</p>
<p>The main objective of the meeting was to progress the work of the DCMI Translation Task Group and discuss the publishing of translated Dublin Core documents so that writers know where and how to make them available locally and internationally.
Meeting participants introduced themselves with representatives attending from Japan, Germany, Canada, Denmark, China, New Zealand and Mexico. Karen introduced the topic of the meeting and the agenda and briefed participants about the Task Group and its work to date.
</p>
<p><b>1.	Publishing language versions Internationally</b>
</p>
<p>Language versions of DC documents are on the DCMI website at the page: “Translations of DCMI Documents” <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/index.shtml" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/index.shtml</a>  Some of the DC language versions link out to a version on the web and others contain a pdf document. 
</p>
<p>Makx Dekkers, Managing Director, DCMI outlined the current situation. Typically an individual or an organisation sends the language version of a DC specification to the DCMI and whatever form it is sent in – e.g. a pdf, URL - is posted to the DCMI translation page.  An issue with URL links is that over time, for various reasons they get lost.  
</p>
<p>Language versions contributed by persistent organisations tend to be stable and when they do disappear can often be traced and the URL replaced, however those contributed by individuals can be more difficult to trace. 
</p>
<p>It is preferable that language version are in pdf format and sent to DCMI as a document, rather than as a web link. Pdf documents can easily be added to the translation page.   
</p>
<p>Many of the language version on the DCMI website are dated. All translations of DC Elements version 1.0 are now deleted from view.  
</p>
<p><br>
<b>2.	DCMI Translation Page</b>
</p>
<p>The DCMI page of translations <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/index.shtml" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/index.shtml</a> is currently arranged by main headings under the type of dc document, with a bulleted list of language versions.
</p>
<p>Alternate suggestions for this arrangement were made:
Marie Claude Côté suggested language as the main heading and then a bulleted list by type of document. 
Makx suggested a link from DCMI specifications and documents to the language version could also be an option.  
Karen suggested include the two types of arrangements, with main headings by document type, and by language - however the page is all handwritten in HTML and update is time consuming.  
Marie and Makx suggested a collaborative international wiki for developing and storing language versions of translations, however persistence could not be guaranteed. 
Shigeo suggested another possibility of separating translations by authority.
</p>
<p>The DCMI Registry contains language versions of terms but the group were unsure if it continues to be maintained. 
</p>
<p><br>
<b>3.	Language Version Provenance</b>
</p>
<p>The group agreed that provenance information was necessary. Yunyun Shen said that in China the dcterms have become a national standard and the maintenance agency has moved to the National Library of China from the Shanghai Library.  
</p>
<p>Karen reported a similar case in New Zealand where Te Kete Ipurangi created the Māori language version however the maintenance agency is now with the National Library of New Zealand. 
</p>
<p>Because of situations like this it is important to include provenance information for language versions. 
</p>
<p>Recently Makx requested provenance information for a French language version of dc terms and it includes: name of document translated, date of translation, URL and copyright statement – see <a href="http://www.yoyodesign.org/doc/dcmi/dcmi-terms/index.html" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.yoyodesign.org/doc/dcmi/dcmi-terms/index.html</a> 
</p>
<p>Provenance information makes it easier for DCMI to maintain multiple translations of one language on the DCMI Translation Page: <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/index.shtml" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/index.shtml</a>.
Action: Karen to follow up with Keven at the Shanghai Library about the transfer of ownership of the Mandarin language version of DCterms. 
</p>
<p><i>Action: Karen develop a provenance template for review by the Task Group.</i>  
</p>
<p>Martin Howley asked whether there are any languages versions not translated that the Working Group or DCMI would like added to the DCMI website. Makx responded that while DCMI would not request a specific translation many of them do need updating. 
</p>
<p>Karen said that a call for translations could be made on listservs on a regular basis and Martin suggested that an appropriate day could be on the on the day of “International day of Translations”
</p>
<p><i>Action: Karen: August 30, 2011 is the “International day of Translations” and so send a message to the DC-General Listserv language versions (and updates) of dc documents on this day. The Group recommend this task is at least done annually.</i>
</p>
<p><br>
<b>4.	Publishing language versions locally</b>
</p>
<p>The Group discussed the development of language versions of dc specifications as local and regional activities.
</p>
<p>Yunyun said that development of dc language versions in an open environment provides opportunity for comment and participation.  Simple script and traditional script needs a crosswalk and so this would be good to do in a collaborative way.
</p>
<p>Stephanie Ruhle said that in Germany different processes have occurred for different documents.  A wiki was used by two organisations for the collaborative development of dcterms and once drafted opened to a blog for comment.  However for the DCMI Type language version a group required the translation. They went ahead and created a German version and asked for comment. The Singapore Framework was translated into German by a small group of individuals.
</p>
<p>The group decided that ideally discussion on development of language versions is done in the local language and in a collaborative way.  
</p>
<p>Marie said where languages cross many regions, for example French, it could be useful to develop an international collaborative environment, to promote dialogue in the language. And Stephanie suggested the use of an open international wiki for this work.    
</p>
<p>Makx said that in the future the DCMI may have a better wiki for DC communities and this could be used to support Task Groups and Communities with a collaborative work space.
</p>
<p>Shigeo Sugimoto said that in Japan simple DC is a national standard and therefore is available as an official document. For the full dcterms there is no official Japanese translation and the most authoritative is available from the National Diet Library of Japan.   
</p>
<p>Stefanie said that it is not a problem to have language versions for the same language and it is not a problem if these are on the DCMI website. A German wiki points to the language versions versions of German at the DCMI translation page.  
</p>
<p>Users of dcterms should be able to identify the most appropriate version for their needs, and can do so long as the versions have provenance information. Lief Anderson agreed that provenance is important and so the group resolved that some general guidelines for writers of translations would ultimately assist users when selecting between multiple versions of a language. 
</p>
<p>Martin asked when a language version is submitted to DCMI who validates it and the answer is, no one at DCMI can do validation. However this Task Group is developing guidelines to help those doing translations.
</p>
<p><br>
<b>5.	What documents can be reported to DCMI?</b> 
Karen asked if DCMI accepts drafts and final versions of translations. The group agreed that this should be so, so long as this information is stated in the provenance of the document.  Acceptance criteria or a checklist is needed to assist translators and the Task Group will develop these. Examples of criteria include peer review of language versions specifying ownership. 
</p>
<p>What happens if there is more than one language version of a dc specification? Lief said this is acceptable providing there is provenance. Marie said that where a language is used in many countries the version should be qualified by the region/country. 
</p>
<p>And what about domain specific translations e.g. Dutch translation of Dublin Core applied to government information?  It would be ideal to have a central place to share these documents. Marie said that this is a is the internationalisation part of this community and that maybe some kind of central place is needed to share these specifications, but this topic is not really in scope for this working group.  
</p>
<p><br>
<b>6.	Case Studies</b>
</p>
<p>Questions have been received from the community’s listserv and so the group tested whether the discussion from this meeting could resolve them. 
</p>
<p>I would like to get the French translation of the DCMI Type vocabulary posted in some way on the DCMI translations page but it is but it is not in a publishable format.
Answer: Output into a pdf version.
</p>
<p>Last year we did a German translation of the DCMI Type Vocabulary [1]. Now some colleagues from the University Library in Münster integrated this into an rdf representation (see attachment) and asked us – the KIM project [2] - to publish it. But we have some problems to publish it with our CMS.
Answer: The DCMI Type Vocabulary can be put into the DC Registry at: <a href="http://dcmi.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/dcregistry/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dcmi.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/dcregistry/</a> where the vocabulary can be output as RDF. Contact is Mitsuharu Nagamori nagamori@SLIS.TSUKUBA.AC.JP or Thomas Baker tbaker@TBAKER.DE 
</p>
<p>We have translated the DC Conference page and requesting DCMI place a link to the translation.
Answer: If supplied Makx can provide a link from the DCMI Conference Home page. Text should be added to the DCMI Translation page at <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/index.shtml" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/resources/translations/index.shtml</a> stating that language versions of DC Conference pages can be found on DCMI Conference Home pages. 
</p>
<p>I did a crosswalk from the English based DC to the Russian version. This was for my Master's paper for my MSLS from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. See the following link for my thesis following link for my thesis: <a href="http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=711&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=2" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=711&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=2</a>
Answer: This could be added to the DCMI Translation page as a link, though it needs provenance. 
<i>Action: Karen to respond to and provide guidelines as discussed in this meeting.</i>
</p>
<p><br>
<b>7.	Revise DCMI Translation Task Group 2010-2011</b>
</p>
<p>The members of the DCMI Translation Task Group Task Group have too many commitments to dedicate substantial time to this work during the next year 2010-2011.
</p>
<p>As a consequence the Task Group recommend that a lightweight version of the translation guidelines is drafted similar to the draft "Using DC" document. 
</p>
<p>The lightweight version will be drafted during 2010/2011 and be ready for review at the meeting of the DCMI Task Group Meeting at DC2011.
</p>
<p>The Task Group resolved that holding the DCMI Translation Task Group meeting at the annual DC conference brings expertise and comment from local participants from a variety of languages and cultures, which is otherwise difficult to obtain.
