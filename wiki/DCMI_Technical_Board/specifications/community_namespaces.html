<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="About_this_proposal"> About this proposal </span>
</h2>
<p>The DCMI Community Specifications Committee supports the development of
"community-developed specifications, vocabularies, and best practices
guidelines in support of resource description" [3].  Some of these
activities produce RDF vocabularies that will need to be published by
DCMI in machine-readable form and in accordance with Linked Data
principles.  There are two precedents for publishing RDF vocabularies in
the DCMI context: the publication of DCMI Metadata Terms, which is
governed by a DCMI Namespace Policy, and the publication in 2007 of
terms related to the Collections Application Profile.  This proposal
describes the two precedents and proposes a policy for the publication
by DCMI of community-developed RDF vocabularies.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="First_precedent:_Core_vocabularies_under_the_DCMI_Namespace_Policy"> First precedent: Core vocabularies under the DCMI Namespace Policy </span>
</h2>
<p>The DCMI Namespace Policy [1], a document first drafted in 2001 and last
revised in 2007, enumerates the URIs of four "DCMI namespaces"
("collections of term URIs managed by DCMI") and specifies the policies
associated with the namespaces with regard to semantic stability and
persistance.  These four namespaces (Elements 1.1, DCMI Metadata Terms,
the DCMI Type Vocabulary, and a small DCAM vocabulary) are vocabularies
for which DCMI has declared a long-term maintenance commitment.
</p>
<p>The DCMI namespaces are updated by editing XML source files and running
a suite of scripts to generate representations of the namespaces in
HTML, RDF/XML, and Turtle.  The source for the the XML files and scripts
is maintained and documented in a Github repository [2].  Whenever
updated representations are generated, they are installed on the DCMI
website and the PURL for each namespace is edited to point to the
updated documentation.  For example, the PURL:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</a>
</blockquote>
<p>resolves by content negotiation to the following documentation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://dublincore.org/2012/06/14/dcterms.rdf" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/2012/06/14/dcterms.rdf</a>
<a href="http://dublincore.org/2012/06/14/dcterms.ttl" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/2012/06/14/dcterms.ttl</a>
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/index.shtml" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/index.shtml</a>
</blockquote>
<p>This process has worked reliably for over a decade, and the scripts are
available in open source and could in principle be adapted to produce
documentation for community-developed vocabularies.  In practice,
however, the process and related software are too complex to recommend
for general use.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Second_precedent:_Vocabularies_related_to_Dublin_Core_Collections_Application_Profile"> Second precedent: Vocabularies related to Dublin Core Collections Application Profile </span>
</h2>
<p>The Dublin Core Collections Application Profile [4] cites terms coined
under two PURL URIs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://purl.org/cld/terms/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://purl.org/cld/terms/</a>
<a href="http://purl.org/cld/cdtype/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://purl.org/cld/cdtype/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>These currently redirect to schemas at:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/collection-terms/2013-06-26/cldterms.rdf" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/collection-terms/2013-06-26/cldterms.rdf</a>
<a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/colldesc-type/2013-06-26/cdtype.rdf" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/colldesc-type/2013-06-26/cdtype.rdf</a>
</blockquote>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Proposed_Namespace_Policy_for_DCMI-community-developed_vocabularies"> Proposed Namespace Policy for DCMI-community-developed vocabularies </span>
</h2>
<p>Taking the Collections AP vocabularies as a precedent:
</p>
<ol><li> Use a new PURL domain, <a href="http://purl.org/dcx/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://purl.org/dcx/</a> as the basis for DCMI community-developed namespaces and term URIs.  For example, if LRMI publishes a new RDF vocabulary, "LRMI Terms", one could use
</li></ol>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://purl.org/dcx/lrmiterms/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://purl.org/dcx/lrmiterms/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>(or similar) as the namespace URI.
</p>
<ol><li> In parallel, create a new directory on the DCMI website, "/dcx", where documentation related to RDF vocabularies can reside.  If we assume that communities will adopt different strategies for publishing their vocabularies -- using HTML webpages with embedded RDFa, RDF/XML, Turtle, or perhaps a combination of the above with content negotiation -- it would be realistic to take a rather broad view of what sorts of materials could be held in this directory.  Ideally, a community would archive teleconference and meeting minutes separately, perhaps on wiki.dublincore.org, and reserve the dublincore.org/dcx directory for namespace documentation per se.  In practice, however, such a distinction could be difficult to enforce, so it might be wisest to give communities some latitude in this regard.
</li></ol>
<p>Under this directory, a community-developed vocabulary could have a directory with a name similar to that used in the PURL, though technically speaking there is no requirement that the names be the same.  For example, an LMRI vocabulary could reside under the directory with names such as
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://dublincore.org/dcx/lrmiterms" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/dcx/lrmiterms</a>
</blockquote>
<ol><li> In accordance with both precedents, representations of RDF vocabularies would be held in directories named using timestamps.  For example, a Turtle representation of LRMI terms could be held in a file with the name:
</li></ol>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://dublincore.org/dcx/lrmiterms/2014-10-01/lrmiterms.ttl" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dublincore.org/dcx/lrmiterms/2014-10-01/lrmiterms.ttl</a>
</blockquote>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion"> Conclusion </span>
</h2>
<p>Communities developing RDF vocabularies will need guidance in how to
publish their vocabularies on the Web, but DCMI need not commit to
publication principles more specific than the requirement that a
vocabulary be made available in one of the RDF serialization syntaxes.
Indeed, best practice in this area continues to evolve, so DCMI should
allow for and anticipate a variety of approaches.
</p>
<p>This proposal could perhaps provide the first draft of a DCMI namespace
policy for community-developed specifications.  Such a policy could
either be issued as a standalone policy document or possibly, in the
interest of keeping related policies together in one place, as an
amendment to the existing DCMI Namespace Policy itself.
