</h1>
<p>More and more members of the library network in German speaking countries publish there data as open "linked" data using different properties and classes and have different ideas what linked data really means. To harmonize this work some colleagues from library service centers, National Libraries etc. in Germany, Austria and Switzerland are working on a best practice guide. A first version of this guide was published in 2013 recommending properties and classes to be used for the RDF representation of the data. The recommendation is mixing properties and classes from different ontologies. The guide will be revised and refined in the next year by specifying syntactic and semantic constraints for the used classes and properties with the purpose to support the interlinking of bibliographic data with data from other communities. If you want to learn more about it see <a href="http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/dc-2013/paper/view/152/167" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/dc-2013/paper/view/152/167</a> and <a href="http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/series/dini-schriften/2013-14/PDF/14.pdf" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/series/dini-schriften/2013-14/PDF/14.pdf</a>

<p><b>Use Case for an Application Profile = Mapping and Validation</b>
</p>
<p>If somebody wants to publish his data in compliance with the recommendation of the DINI AG KIM he starts with mapping his data to properties and classes listed in the best practice guide. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> First he needs a human readable documentation of the properties and classes he should use also describing the constraints concerning obligation, occurence and possible values of the properties.
</li>
<li> For the technical mapping he could use a "template" describing what is needed in a machine-readable way.
</li>
<li> During the mapping process he wants to automatically check the output for its compliance with the recommended properties, classes and constraints and needs a "schema" to do so.
</li>
</ul>
