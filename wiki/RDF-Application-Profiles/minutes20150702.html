  DCMI RDF AP Task Group
http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/RDF_Application_Profiles
Meeting date: July 2, 2015
Meeting link: https://meetings.webex.com/collabs/#/meetings/detail?uuid=M1RMXAWHCVXID8E5NEAFH8K88R-JV0D&amp;rnd=416945.34093

Attendees: Karen, Hugo, Corey, Thomas

Notes from the meeting

Next meetings: July 16 &amp; July 30 -- discuss white paper one-pager
people haven't had a chance to read it yet
have Corey and/or Tom give an overview
 We should try to identify action items or bigger tasks for the group relating to APs

Task for the group: Identify current requirements that are specific to APs
Add any that we've missed
Hugo: taking second look at W3C requirements for AP-related functions

RELATIONSHIP OF AP TO SHACL
Corey: could include validation of non-RDF data that is connected to the graph,
e.g. links to thumbnails/check-sum
If this is beyond what an AP should DO, then we should still specify it , even
as documentation

Corey: I don't have a single data store that provides a graph
Some of the data may not be behind a sparql query
The selection process is separate from the validation context

Hugo: selection of graph is/should be agnostic to validation
creation of graph has to happen before validation

Tom's "active triples" will probably implement SHACL
Graph selection decision will be before SHACL call

Corey, the architecture of the graph is what DCAP should define

Hugo: validation can be at conceptual level or architectural level.
conceptual validation should remain the same even if architecture changes

Note: most recent version of Topbraid (including Free) has SHACL features:
