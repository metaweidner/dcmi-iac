<p>Teleconference for DCMI Multilingual vocabulary kick-off
</p>
<p>Chair:     Michael Lauruhn
</p>
<p>Attendees: Andrew Cunningham, Gordon Dunsire, Diane Hillmann, Gudrun Johannsen, Michael Lauruhn, Véronique Malaisé, Jon Phipps, Jonathan Pool, Johan Stapel
</p>
<p>When:     2012-2-14, Wednesday 10:00 EST
</p>
<p>The initial meeting of the Multilingual Vocabulary research group began with a briefing of possible outcomes for the group, especially in light of the upcoming DCMI Vocabulary Management Community's inaugural meeting in London on April 26, 2012. Ideally, in the time leading up to the April meeting, the group should be focused on two areas: articulating Use Cases in the space that would be worth doing research in, and, researching existing standards in the area of multilingual and multi-regional vocabularies. As an outcome, the group should be able to propose a formal Task Group to research Use Cases, models and standards at the April meeting.
</p>
<p>The group then had a brief discussion of what existing standards were available to begin with. The list of standards will be kept <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wiki/Multilingual_Vocabulary_Standards" title="Multilingual Vocabulary Standards"> here</a>.
