(11:21:41 AM) Francesca: There are not many tools that can do this
(11:21:52 AM) Francesca: Only stand alone applications
(11:22:48 AM) ChiaraL: RDF based on triplets - subject, predicate, object
(11:23:02 AM) Francesca: Also, need of comunication between registries and vocabularies

(11:32:42 AM) Francesca: Parallelwith the CMS commuinity which is much more community centred
(11:33:06 AM) Francesca: The vocabulary and thesaury community should establish something similar
(11:33:09 AM) ChiaraL: DCT: title / RDA: hasTitleManifestation / ISBD: hasTitleProper

(11:40:20 AM) ChiaraL: .. illustrator is a sub-property of creator
(11:41:12 AM) Francesca: A series oftools±
(11:41:37 AM) Francesca: Drupal

(11:57:23 AM) Francesca: Which are your wishes concerning tools
(11:57:49 AM) Francesca: It should be collaborative and easy to use
(11:58:04 AM) ChiaraL: …the advice at the moment is to keep FRBR and RDA separated, but WHY??
(11:59:02 AM) Francesca: It should implement a functionality for visualisation of onthologies
(12:00:00 PM) Francesca: We need to manage more than one vocabulaires at the time
(12:00:06 PM) Vcharles: ...It's important to get the disciplinary perspective in the documentation as well

(12:04:31 PM) Francesca: Vocabulary allignment, keep track of the used vocabulaires
(12:04:45 PM) Francesca: There are a few tools that keep track of the allignment
(12:06:50 PM) ChiaraL: DCT is the high lever glue, and bibliographic info is the refinement of DC
(12:08:39 PM) ChiaraL: DCT - Check the definitions to make sure they are utilized correctly
(12:10:00 PM) Francesca: Need of a function that uses only the needed onthology module

(12:10:33 PM) ChiaraL: Thesaurus and controlled vocabulary management needed to link a certain name in different languages
(12:11:14 PM) Vcharles: ....we need voc and systems able to support the notion of volatility
(12:12:31 PM) ChiaraL: URI for ‘dog’ is connected to the URI for ‘cane’ – that’s how we have a property
(12:14:07 PM) Vcharles: ....we also need to capture the voc within a particular time/period
(12:17:06 PM) Vcharles: ....the key seems to define clear use cases!!!!!
(12:19:26 PM) Francesca: Authomatic vocabulaires allignment
(12:20:06 PM) Francesca: What about if the vocabularies are the similar, how to give them an exact match
(12:21:33 PM) Francesca: There isa specific matching formula, forexample in SKOS it would be `exact`
(12:23:17 PM) Francesca: Is there enough documentation on how to use terms in onthologies
