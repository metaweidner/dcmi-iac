4. Presentations:<br>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Overview of Scientific Metadata for Data Publishing, Citation, and Curation</b> (Alex Ball, Research Officer, UKOLN) (slides:  <a href="http://opus.bath.ac.uk/26309" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://opus.bath.ac.uk/26309</a>)<br>
</li></ul>
<p>Scientific data as a resource type is very hard to characterize, not least because of the sheer variety of requirements placed on it by different areas of research. It is no surprise, then, that scientific metadata has traditionally been very discipline- and application-specific. With the rise of interdisciplinary research and data sharing, though, there is increasing pressure for common standards in areas such as data discovery and curation. Mr. Ball will report on his research assessing the feasibility of a common metadata profile for scientific data discovery, and ask "Is it worth a try?"<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>  <b>Elsevier Metadata Design for Smart Content</b> (Michael Lauruhn, Disruptive Technology Director, Elsevier Labs; Véronique Malaisé, Head of Taxonomy Center, Content Enrichment Center) <br>
</li>
<li> Elsevier researchers will review SKOS and Resource Description Framework (RDF) considerations for Smart Content initiatives that facilitate the move into a Linked Data environment. The presentation will include an overview of EMMeT (Elsevier Merged Medical Taxonomy) and ongoing research in the area of Smart Content including an overview of prototypes and previews of products.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Open discussion <br>
6. Future charter and group activity <br>
