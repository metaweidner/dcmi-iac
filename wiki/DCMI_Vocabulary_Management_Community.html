<ul><li> A new short-term cooperative project between the  federated repository of semantic assets hosted on Joinup.eu and the Open Metadata Registry (OMR) has been initiated and is in active development.  The focus of the project is to determine whether and how the current OMR vocabulary descriptions can be used effectively within the Service Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS). The <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wiki/ADMS/OMR_Project" title="ADMS/OMR Project">ADMS/OMR Project</a> will operate in public, and welcomes comment from the DCMI Vocabulary Management Community.

<p>As part of the inaugural meeting planning, a small group organized by Mike Lauruhn is discussing issues around <b>multilingual vocabularies</b>.  The group has put up a <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wikihttp://wiki.dublincore.org/Multilingual_Vocabulary_Standards" class="external text" rel="nofollow">wiki page to support this activity</a> which carries some links to standards of interest as well as reports of their telecons. The group led discussions at the inaugural meeting of the Community.

<p>See also the <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wikihttp://wiki.dublincore.org/Vocabulary_Management_System_Task_Group" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Vocabulary Management System Task Group</a>, a joint task group of the Architecture Forum and Registry Community tasked with (1) develop evaluation criteria for a DCMI vocabulary management system (VMS) that will meet current and future needs of DCMI; (2) assess existing candidate VMS applications based on the developed criteria; and (3) report its analysis to the Oversight Committee and Advisory Board along with its recommendation of one or two viable VMS candidates for replacing the current DCMI vocabulary management environment. The TG will also propose a community-driven approach to transition from the current to a new environment in light of its recommendations.
