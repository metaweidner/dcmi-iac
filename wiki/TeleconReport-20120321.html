</p>
<p>When: 2012-3-21, Wednesday 11:00 AM EDT
</p>
<p>Tentative Agenda:
</p>
<p>Discussion of scenarios (3) submitted as potential Use Cases for this group to research. Are they in scope for this team? Are they relevant? What details or questions are needed to make these more comprehensive? 
</p>
<p> 1. When integrating variations of languages across regions and countries, how can terms be properly distinguished? Spanish from Spain or Spanish from Latin America; Portugal and Brazil; U.K. and U.S.A. English; etc.
</p>
<p> 2. Multiregional vocabularies in which relations (hierarchical or ontological) vary from region-to-region. How can these be represented in a single model? Would like to see if there are existing models or standards that attempt to address issues like this. Long-term would be the maintenance and best practices for managing such a vocabulary.
</p>
<p> 3. "A Use Case that might be interesting to look at is Getty’s Art and Artist Thesaurus. On the one hand the source vocabulary which is in English is constantly growing through contributions of various institutions; on the other hand it’s been translated into Spanish, Chinese, German, Italian and Dutch. There are huge challenges here both on the administrative side as well as on the user side having to do also with legal issues. This is a project where a lot of thinking and practical experiences have been gathered although I believe the knowledge is scattered around many different stakeholders."
</p>
<p>Any other scenarios or Use Cases for consideration.
</p>
<p>Any comment on <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wiki/Multilingual_Vocabulary_Standards" title="Multilingual Vocabulary Standards">Standards</a> collected so far.
</p>
<p>Discuss actions for next call and work to be done prior to April meeting in London.
