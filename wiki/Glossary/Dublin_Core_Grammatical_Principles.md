## Dublin Core Grammatical Principles 

In the early years of the Dublin Core community, metadata came to be seen in linguistic terms, starting with the characterization of the fifteen-element Dublin Core by Tom Baker as a "metadata pidgin". Even pidgin languages have grammar, and the statement grammar from 2000 pictured below was in part an early attempt to popularize the notion of metadata as being based on meaningful "statements" by way of analogy to commonly understood notions of natural-language grammar<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>. The model included a rough mapping of the Dublin Core "grammar" to RDF statements (see diagrams below). This early notion of Dublin Core grammar, though oriented to statements, was heavily oriented to string values over URIs.

After the DCMI Usage Board was founded in 2001, the Usage Board developed a document, "DCMI Grammatic Principles"<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup>, which served as a point of reference for its vocabulary maintenance work until it was superseded in 2005 by the [DCMI Abstract Model](http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wiki/Glossary/DCMI_Abstract_Model "Glossary/DCMI Abstract Model"). The typology of terms outlined in the Usage Board principles reflected the terminology that resulted from early Dublin Core workshops at which concepts such as "element", "qualifier", "encoding scheme" were coined and defined -- concepts which with the work on the Abstract Model from 2003 to 2007 were eventually harmonized with, and superseded by, the RDF terminology of properties, classes, and datatypes.
