## Metadata Enrichment 

The idea of converting or enhancing string values with controlled URIs for agents, subjects, time periods, or places. Triplification.

Maybe cite Ron Daniel's SAFARI roadmap:

- **Start Simple** : Mapping current data and metadata to the Dublin Core's "First Fifteen" elements
- **Add to the Core** : Adding additional Dublin Core metadata elements and local elements; and integrating multiple datasets together 
- **Faceted Taxonomy** : Shifting from text values in the various fields to a faceted taxonomy with managed lists of values
- **Adopt Standards** : Agreeing to and using standardized vocabularies for key parts of the business
- **RDF and Web Identifiers** : Switching to URL identifiers for field names, vocabulary names, vocabulary values, etc., relating this to RDF, and hiding the details from normal situations
- **Integrate** : Integrating local information with the Linked Data cloud, controlling access, and putting the broad array of data to use
