</h2>
<p>As of 2010, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative's mission includes the goal of "developing and maintaining international standards for describing resources".
</p>
<p>It has not always been this way.  The foundational workshop of March 1995 in Dublin, Ohio aimed at improving the "discovery" of electronic resources on a rapidly growing World-Wide Web.  The approach taken was that of defining "elements" for simple "records" describing "document-like objects" [1].  Implicit was the traditional model of a search application indexing text fields (value strings) for retrieval.
</p>
<p>What actually happened, as we know, was that Google developed a radically different, wildly successful, solution to the problem of resource discovery.  The Dublin Core community's understanding of metadata's role subsequently evolved in
several ways:
</p>
<ul><li> The focus on "resource discovery" came to be seen as artificial -- what descriptive element might not be conceived as "useful for discovery"? -- and the objective was redefined as that of "resource description".
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The scope of Dublin Core metadata was broadened from "electronic resources" to encompass, in principle, any object that can be identified, whether electronic, real-world, or conceptual, and particularly including resources of the sort named in the DCMI Type Vocabulary [2], such as physical objects, software, services, and sound.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Attention shifted from the "record" as an aggregate information object to individual metadata "statements" designed to be merged and recombined in an emerging Linked Data environment (see glossary entry "records or statements").
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Metadata came to be seen as valuable less for the value strings it carried than for its use of URIs -- controlled identifiers for subject headings, Web documents, people, and the like -- and for the role of properties (such as Dublin Core properties) in defining explicit links and cross-references between resources.  URI-rich metadata came to be seen as the basis for richly interlinked browsing and data mashups.

<ul><li> Anything that might be identified. Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image, a service (for example, "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of other resources. Not all resources are network "retrievable"; for example, human beings, corporations, concepts and bound books in a library can also be considered resources.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Metadata
</p>
<p>@@@ <i>The simplest definition of metadata is "structured data about data." Metadata is descriptive information about a resource whether it be physical or electronic. The underlying concepts behind metadata have been in use for as long as collections of information have been organized. Library card catalogs represent a well-established example of metadata for resource discovery.  Metadata can be generated either "by hand" or derived automatically using software.  Understanding of metadata role has evolved: Label, annotate with text-string values / linking information with URIs - navigating, structured browsing, contextualizing, bundle of links for context.</i>
</p>
<ul>
<li> "elements" for a simple "record" -- one "more informative than an index entry but... less complete than a formal cataloging record" -- for describing "document-like objects" [1].  The implicit model was that of a search application indexing text fields to aid retrieval.
</li>
<li> What actually happened, as we know, was Google, which solved the problem of resource discovery in a radically different way.  The Dublin Core community's understanding of metadata's role subsequently evolved in several ways:
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li> Record to statements (see "records or statements")
