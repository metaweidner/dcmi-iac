<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Announcement_of_a_major_conference_on_libraries_and_the_Semantic_Web.2C_26-27_April_2012">Announcement of a major conference on libraries and the Semantic Web, 26-27 April 2012</span>
</h3>
<p>April 2012 marks the fifth anniversary of the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/meeting.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Data Model Meeting at the British Library, London</a> attended by participants interested in the fit between RDA: resource description and access and the models used in other metadata communities, especially those working in the Semantic Web environment. This meeting, informally known as the “London Meeting”, has proved to be a critical point in the trajectory of libraries from the traditional data view to linked data and the Semantic Web.
</p>
<p>A <b>one-day seminar on Friday 27 April 2012</b> will mark the anniversary of the "London Meeting" with a programme to describe progress since 2007, mark the anniversary, and look to further collaboration in the future.  As a DCMI-UK regional meeting, the seminar is endorsed by DCMI and its UK Member, JISC.
</p>
<p>Speakers will include participants at the 2007 meeting and other significant players in library data and the Semantic Web. Papers from the seminar will be published by DCMI and available freely online.
</p>
<p>The seminar will be preceded by inaugural meetings of the new <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wikihttp://wiki.dublincore.org/DCMI_Vocabulary_Management_Community" class="external text" rel="nofollow">DCMI Vocabulary Management Community</a> and <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wikihttp://wiki.dublincore.org/Bibliographic_Metadata_Task_Group" class="external text" rel="nofollow">DCMI Bibliographic Metadata Task Group</a> on <b>Thursday 26 April 2012</b> which will be open free but with limited room capacity (36 people).
</p>
<p>The venue for both days is the British Library, St Pancras, London.
</p>
<p>The London Meeting stimulated significant development of Semantic Web representations of the major international bibliographic metadata models, including IFLA’s Functional Requirements family and the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), and MARC as well as RDA itself. Attention is now beginning to focus on the management and sustainability of this activity, and the development of high-level semantic and data structures to support library applications.
</p>
<p>This is a preliminary announcement; further information will be circulated in due course and published on the discussion lists and wikis for both groups.
