<p><b>Note:</b> These scenarios are intended to assist catalogers in visualizing how their work might flow in a setting that used RDA Vocabularies and FRBR relationships. The goal here is just to show how these packages of information might fit together and how catalogers can use their knowledge  and experience in different contexts.
</p>
<p><b>Caveats:</b>
1. The labels used are those verified using the latest RDAToolkit ERDs.
2. Identifiers are assumed to be mandatory but many will presumably be system supplied; only some "standard" ones are used in these examples.
3. Assumptions are made about how systems using RDA will assist in the process. Your mileage may vary.

<p><i>Jane Cataloger selects a second item to catalog from her gift collection.  This item is a festschrift in honor of an environmental activist who died young, containing contributions by a number of important writers in the field.  Jane begins by searching the library database and publisher databases for the collection itself.  She finds an existing record for the collection as a work, from an ONIX record contributed by the publisher. She uses that record as a basis for the work description, adding a subject heading for the collection and a link to an existing authority record for the honoree and another to the editor of the collection.</i>

<p><i>Jane Cataloger is working on cataloging the individual DVDs from the Ford at Fox Collection.  The selector has repackaged the individual DVDs in containers and asked Cataloging to catalog them separately. However, this package contains two DVDs for the film The Iron Horse. She searches the library  database and finds:</i>
</p>
<p>A work record for the Ford at Fox collection
</p>
<p>A work record for the film The Iron Horse: 
</p>
<pre>* Director: John Ford
* Preferred title of work: The Iron Horse
* Form of work: Motion Picture
* Original language of work: English
* Original year of release: 1924
* Actor: George O'Brien
* Actor: Madge Bellamy
* Actor: Charles Edward Bull
* Production company: Fox
* Genre of work: Feature film
* Genre of work: Silent film
* Genre of work : Fiction film
* Genre of work: Western film
* Subject of work: Railroads--West (U.S.--History--19th century--Drama
</pre>
<p><i>There are assorted other people related to the work, but Jane's not working for a film archive, so she doesn't add any more of them to the work record.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Now, the two DVDs are two different versions of the film.  Presumably she could choose to catalog the DVDs separately or together, but since her selector gave them to her together, she catalogs them together. One DVD is the International version, and the other is the US version.</i>
Both have scores by William Perry.  So she creates two expression records:
</p>
<p><i>Jane finds this expression record attached to a manifestation released by the British Film Institute:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Language of expression: English
* Composer of musical score of expression: William Perry
* Running time of expression: 133 minutes
</pre>
<p><i>Jane wonders if this is the same as her International version.  It has the same running time and also has a score by William Perry.  So she takes a chance and adds to the record:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Name of expression: International Version
* Language of expression: English
* Composer of musical score of expression: William Perry
</pre>
<p><i>[In addition, this has optional French or Spanish intertitles so presumably each of those would also be expressions, so Jane would need two more expression records?]</i>
</p>
<p><i>Jane does not find this expression record and needs to create it:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Name of expression: U.S. Version
* Language of Expression: English
* Composer of musical score of expression: William Perry
* Running time of expression: 150 min.
</pre>
<p><i>One or both of these also has a commentary track by Robert Birchard (mea culpa, i didn't note which one when i cataloged it, nor did anyone in OCLC).  So presumably the one with the commentary track is yet another expression. so so far Jane has had to use one existing expression record and had to create 6 more expression records for this.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Jane is unsure which other expression is already in OCLC.  The two VHS tapes from Nostalgia Family Video run 133 minutes so Jane thinks they might be the international Version, though this is not stated. However, they have an orchestral score by an unidentified composer or compiler, so are a different expression.  So she doesn't link to this expression record.</i>
</p>
<p><i>She also finds that the DVDs have a featurette; a restoration comparison; vintage program gallery; advertising gallery; still gallery.  Jane is tired by this time and decides that these are untitled and worthy of only a note, instead of creating work records for each.  Jane is also starting to worry that the implication of a "restoration comparison" means that there may be a difference in expression between the BFI version and this version, but she really has no way to research this.  What does Jane do?  Flip a coin?  Try to call film experts?  Ignore it and let it pass?</i>
</p>
<p><i>Ignoring that for the moment, Jane can finally gets down to the manifestation:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Place of Publication: Beverly Hills, Calif.
* Publisher: Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment
* Date: 2007
* Media type: DVD;
* Other technical characteristics: NTSC, all region, full frame, choice of Dolby 5.1 or stereo for the music track <i>(uh oh, Jane wonders if these constitute different expressions, but decides not to think about it and just lets this pass)</i>
* Extent: 2 videodiscs : sd., b&amp;w, 4 3/4 in.
</pre>
<p><i>She also has to link to the Ford at Fox set somehow for the series. Jane thinks this is manifestation information, and is unsure how the linkage will work between individually cataloged manifestations and the set, which presumably has work, expression, and manifestation records.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Jane has now spent two days cataloging this resource. Her boss calls her into her office to explain why she should spend so much time and money playing with her records when they could just outsource it to India.  Jane goes back to her desk and looks at the next time in her pile, which is a videodisc containing 30 short films by filmmaker Dennis Oppenheim.  The one under that is a disc 60 short animated films by a variety of people she's never heard of. Next is the second</i>
volume with another 60 films.  She contemplates the idea of work records for these, then goes home and slits her wrists.

<p><i>Jane Cataloger next picks up a musical score, an arrangement of Luigi Boccherini's Concerto in D major op. 34 for violoncello and orchestra, edited, with cadenzas and piano reduction by Luigi Silva.</i>
</p>
<p><i>She searches the library database for the original work and finds:</i>

</p>
<p><i>Theoretically, the work record for G. 483 could have a link to the following work; however, since Jane cannot identify the actual title assigned to the two cadenzas written by Silva, she does not create this work record:</i>

</p>
<p>[Notes: I’ve included in this scenario some of the relationships that will be available through FRBR.  See <a href="http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org/concept/list/page/1/vocabulary_id/90.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">for a preliminary listing</a>. I’ve also included “Defendant” as a role--since as a former law librarian I think these are important, and hope some conversations about their relevance can be initiated. Also, although item information is potentially of interest for these materials in particular, I’ve not included that level in this scenario--Diane.]
</p>
<p><i>Joshua Cataloger was working on a collection of materials accumulated by a nineteenth century criminal lawyer who practiced near Saratoga, NY.  This lawyer worked on several high visibility murder cases (the reality TV of the 19th century) and kept meticulous records of his trials, including extensive newspaper reports, in scrapbooks.  He published (as was common during this time) books that included his lengthy summations to juries and other testimony and comment during trial.  He also had a habit of pasting letters and other related items inside the front and back covers of volumes he owned.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Joshua was working on the records of one infamous murder trial (which went to two trials after the accused was found to have tampered with the first jury), and found that one of the letters pasted in front of a copy of his published “Closing argument of Nathaniel C. Moak at Ballston Spa, October 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, 1879 ...” was from Wilkie Collins, credited for the first mystery novels. Joshua transcribed the letter, and discovered that it was in reply to Moak, who had mentioned Collins’ novel The Moonstone in his argument and had sent a copy of the book to Collins.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Given the importance of the letter, which asked exactly the kinds of questions a novelist would ask of a practicing lawyer (“How do you keep track of the facts as you deliver your argument?” was one), Joshua felt that he must include the letter in his catalog record.  His problem was exacerbated by the fact that the library had three copies, two bound with another Billings trial pamphlet, written by someone else.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Joshua started by creating work records for the first two published works, issued together--one by Moak, the other by Judge Landon. Work 1:</i>  
</p>
<pre>* Author: Moak, Nathaniel C. (Nathaniel Cleveland ), 1833-1892.
* Title of the Work: Closing argument of Nathaniel C. Moak at Ballston Spa, 	October 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, 1878, on behalf of the people, in the case of the people against Jesse Billings, Jr.
* Subject: Trials (Murder) -- New York (State) -- Ballston Spa
* Defendant: Billings, Jesse
* Original Language of the Work: English
* Has a complement: [id for letter to N. Moak from W. Collins]
</pre>
<p><i>Work 2:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Author: Landon, Judson S. (Judson Stuart), 1832-1881.
* Title of the Work:  : The charge of Hon. Judson S. Landon, presiding judge at the Saratoga oyer and terminer, in the case of the people against Jesse Billings, Jr.
* Subject: Trials (Murder) -- New York (State) -- Ballston Spa
* Defendant: Billings, Jesse
* Original Language of the Work: English
</pre>
<p><i>Joshua then moves on to create an expression record for each work, with language and content type elements.</i> 
</p>
<pre>* Language of Expression: English
* Content Type: Text
</pre>
<p><i>The manifestation record is tricky, because there are separate title pages for each of the works (used for the work records), plus a collective title page for the combined work, which is the only place that the “reporter” is mentioned. Joshua puzzles about this, and finally decides to include the reporter in the manifestation record, though he’s not sure this is correct.</i>
</p>
<pre>* Title proper: Closing argument of Nathaniel C. Moak at Ballston Spa, October 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, 1878, on behalf of the people, in the case of the people against Jesse Billings, Jr.; with the charge of the Hon. Judson S. Landon, presiding justice
* Statement of responsibility relating to title: reported by Buel C. Andrews
* Reporter: Andrews, Buel C. [note that the RDA roles does not yet include “reporter”]
* Place of Production: Albany
* Producer’s name: Weed, Parsons and Company, printers
* Date of Production: 1879
* Extent: 189, 32 pages [note that the sets of pages reflect the two parts issued together]
</pre>
<p><i>Joshua then creates a work level description for the letter, in order to relate it properly to the one copy of the combined work in which it is pasted. He’s not quite sure how to do this, but personfully wades in and makes the attempt, and creates a work record for the letter, and a work/work relationship between it and the Moak argument. Even though the letter has both a bibliographic and physical relationship with the other work, he’s pretty sure the bibliographic one is important enough to highlight.</i>
</p>
<pre>* Author: Collins, Wilkie, 1824-1889
* Title of work: Letter to Nathaniel Moak, January 13, 1880
* Original language of the work: English
* Complements: [id for Moak’s Closing argument]
</pre>
<p><i>How to note that it’s handwritten?  He’s not sure, so he moves on to expression:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Language of Expression: English
* Content Type: Text
</pre>
<p><i>He includes some information on the letter as a manifestation:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Extent: 2 pages 
</pre>
<p><i>In order to completely describe the items where there is a “bound with” relationship, Joshua creates a third work record for the medical testimony, related to the others both bibliographically (it’s about the same trials), and physically (it’s bound in the same physical volume as two copies of the other combined work, though not the letter).</i>
</p>
<pre>* Author: Balch, Lewis, 1847-1909
* Title of work:  A review of the second trial of Jesse Billings, Jr., for the murder of his wife : tried at the Saratoga oyer and terminer, Balston, Saratoga county, April, 1880. Being chiefly a review of the medical testimony
* History of the work: Read before the Medical Society of New York, February 3, 1881 and Reprinted from its Transactions for 1881.
* Is a reproduction of: [insert link to version in the transactions of the Medical Society]
* Subject: Trials (Murder) -- New York (State) -- Ballston Spa
* Defendant: Billings, Jesse

<p><i>Joshua moves on to the expression record:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Language of Expression: English

<p><i>And to the manifestation:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Title proper: A review of the second trial of Jesse Billings, Jr., for the murder of his wife : tried at the Saratoga oyer and terminer, Ballston, Saratoga county, April, 1880. Being chiefly a review of the medical testimony
* Place of Production: Syracuse
* Producer’s name: Truair, Smith &amp; Bruce
* Date of production: 1881
* Extent: 28 pages 
</pre>
<p><i>Joshua is not really sure what to do about the fact that this publication is part of a library created collection of materials about the Billings trials.  Should the collection itself have a separate description? He thinks it probably does, but isn’t sure where in the Work/Expression/Manifestation/Item the relationship between the overall collection and this piece is properly expressed.</i>  
</p>
<p><i>Uh oh. Joshua realizes that there’s a digital version of all these materials (except the letter).  He goes on coffee break.</i>

<p><i>Jane Cataloger's library receives a new copy of William Golding's "Lord of the Flies," replacing one that was returned with too many missing pages.

<p><i>Jane knows (or at least assumes) that the original work was written in English and the title was Lord of the Flies, so she has the beginning of a work record:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Author: Golding, William <i>(Jane finds an authority record in the catalog for "Golding, William, 1911-1993" and uses this form in her record.)</i>
* Title of the work: Lord of the flies

<p><i>There is one last thing: The book is part of the "Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century" series. This is a publisher series, so she knows that her library will not have a separate record for it. However, she knows that the series is popular among her readers, and she wants them to be able to search on the series and see which ones the library owns. She adds a series field to the record:</i>

<p><i>Jane Cataloger is working on box of donated books. The donor was obviously an old lefty, and she sets aside the pamphlet version of Mao's "Oppose Book Worship" to hang up on the staff room bulletin board (anonymously).</i>
</p>
<p><i>The Vanguard edition of Peter Kropotkin's "The Conquest of Bread" will be a welcome addition to the library's holdings in the area of revolutionary literature.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The information she has from the volume is:</i>
</p>
<pre>* The Conquest of Bread
* by Peter Kropotkin
* Author of "fields, Factories, and Workshops" "The Memoirs of a Revolutionist," Etc.
* New York
* Vanguard Press
* Published, 1906
* Vanguard printings: first - August 1926, second - November, 1927
* Printed in the United States of American 
* Union Bug 489
</pre>
<p><i>Jane wants to get this book onto the shelf as quickly and efficiently (read: unexpensively) as possible, so she's going to create a minimal record. She starts with the author's name. She doesn't have an authority record under "Kropotkin." She's aware that his "true" name would have a Russian form, but she doesn't want to research it, and she doesn't think that the Russian form of the name would be particularly useful for her users. She'll use "Kropotkin, Peter" and not create an authority record for the name.</i> 
</p>
<p><i>Jane thinks about what to do about the work. She's pretty sure that the book was not originally written in English, but there is no mention of translation in this edition. Also, she's pretty sure that the book was written before 1906. She uses what she has to create a work record for the book:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Author: Kropotkin, Peter 
* Title of the Work: The conquest of bread
</pre>
<p><i>Next, she creates a brief expression record:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Language of expression: English
* Content type: Text
</pre>
<p><i>Lastly, she creates a manifestation record with the following information:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Title proper: The conquest of bread
* Statement of responsibility relating to title: by Peter Kropotkin
* Place of publication: New York
* Publisher's name: Vanguard Press
* Date of manufacture: 1927 (Because she suspects that the 1906 date does not refer to this manifestation, she uses the printing date.)
* Extent: 214 p.
</pre>
<p><i>She adds the RFID tag with the book's accession number, which creates an item record:</i>
</p>
<pre>* Identifier for the item: 00334872
</pre>
<p><i>(N.B. Original was in French. First published in Paris in 1892. The LC Name Authority heading is: "Kropotkin, Petr Alekseevich, kni︠a︡zʹ, 1842-1921" None of the editions I could find named a translator, probably because the work was originally serialized in a London lefty newspaper founded by Kropotkin himself.)</i>
