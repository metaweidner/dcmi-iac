<p>The DCMI Localization &amp; Internationalization Community meeting will be held 22 October at 16:00-17:30. [<a href="http://www.asis.org/Conferences/DC2010/program-sessions.html#localization" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] 
</p>
<p><br>
The main objective of the meeting is to progress the work of the DCMI Translation Task Group[1] and discuss the publishing of translated Dublin Core documents so that writers know where and how to make them available locally and internationally. 
</p>
<p><br>
We would like to hear from members of this community about experiences in publishing translations of Dublin Core documents. We have some publishing case studies to help guide the DCMI Translation Task Group meeting agenda and more would be beneficial. Please send us your case studies and experiences for publishing translations of DC documents, or tell us about them at the meeting. 
</p>
<p><br>
There will be time set aside at the meeting for participants to raise any localisation and internationalisation topics about using metadata and vocabularies.
