<p>1. When expanding a vocabulary to multiple regions and variations of languages occur, what is the best practice for representing them? Examples include Spanish from Spain or Spanish from Latin America; Portuguese used in Portugal vs Brazil; U.K. and U.S.A. English.
</p>
<p>2. Multiregional vocabularies in which relations (hierarchical or ontological) vary between regions. What is the best practice for representing the relations in a single model? Are there existing models or standards that attempt to address issues like this? What are the maintenance issues and best practices for managing such a Model?
</p>
<p>3. Governance issues that are unique to multilingual vocabularies, especially knowledge responsibilities are shared around multiple stakeholders
