</h2>
<p>There are seven headings (or elements) used in this directory to describe the metadata schemes for scientific data, which serves as the metadata for metadata schemes. Based on the concept of "less is more", we try to locate headings that are most important to identify metadata schemes. Here are the definitions of the seven headings and detailed requirements to use them.
</p>
<p><b>Name</b>
</p>
<p>The full name of the metadata scheme. If the scheme has an abbreviation, put it in parentheses after the full name.
</p>
<p><b>Description</b>
</p>
<p>A brief description (about 2-3 sentences) outlines the objectives of the scheme and what kind of data it intends to describe. 
</p>
<p><b>Identifier of Latest Version</b>
</p>
<p>The uniformed resource identifier (URL) of the scheme’s latest version. It is usually a URL. If a version # is applicable, put it before the URL.
</p>
<p><b>Terms</b>
</p>
<p>Introduction or handbook of the terms that the scheme defines and employs. It can be a URL to a web page or a file.
</p>
<p><b>Domain/Discipline/Subject</b>
</p>
<p>Data in what domain/discipline/subject the scheme intends to describe or cover.
</p>
<p><b>Maintenance Authority</b>
</p>
<p>The organization or person responsible for the maintenance of the scheme, typically the creator of the metadata scheme. (Provide a URL to the creator’s homepage or about page if necessary.)
</p>
<p><b>Year of Creation</b>
</p>
<p>The date the first edition of the metadata scheme was created. (format examples: If we know the date for sure, 2012; if we can infer, [2012]; if we can’t find it, N/A.)
