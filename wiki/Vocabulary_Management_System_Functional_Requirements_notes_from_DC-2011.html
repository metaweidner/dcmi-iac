<p>Notes taken by Gordon Dunsire during various sessions at DC-2011:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Multilingual capacity; get the existing translations in, then reviewed and updated.
</li>
<li> Support translation statuses (e.g. official, endorsed); secure management of translations (can be very controversial).
</li>
<li> Interaction with (new) DCMI Website.
</li>
<li> Manage/publish alignments of DCMI vocabularies with other namespaces.
</li>
<li> Support the development and publication of best practice guidelines for vocabulary management.
</li>
<li> Support policy decisions in the area of vocabulary management and use.
</li>
<li> Ensure no dependencies between the data created and maintained by the system, and the system itself (e.g. URIs independent of any local system identifiers).
</li>
</ul>
