title: Beyond library catalogs

## If libraries move away from catalogs in the old sense, would they move towards something like a search interface? What would this new interface look like? 

Interfaces for browsing the Semantic Web are still the object of research. The simple structure of RDF allows many more possibilities than traditional record-based resource discovery services, such as modern animation and visualization techniques. RDF itself has a powerful visualization in the RDF graph where triple subjects and objects are shown as nodes connected by lines representing predicates (properties, or relationships). Catalog users are becoming familiar with tag clouds for finding related resources, so these may have a role. What is certain is that users should have more choice and control of how information is presented for searching, navigation, and display. Our current lists and tables will be just another choice.
