</h2>
<p>The Planning Committee shall actively and systematically identify and articulate potential areas of focus for DCMI "work themes" through discovery and assessment of current and emerging drivers and enablers of innovation in the metadata ecosystem. The Committee will generate committed activities to stimulate and maintain membership capacity building. The Committee shall work with DCMI Communities and Task Groups to initiate and organize around themes, and develop work packages to address areas of focus.

<i><b>[jb]:</b> I have deleted governance, membership and leadership areas because they are redundant with OC Membership &amp; Finance Committee. Areas of focus and work themes may be more appropriate for AB than standards which are now purview of Usage Board. Usage Board should be renamed Standards Advisory Board, or Technical Advisory Board, or something else like that.</i>
</p>
<p><i><b>[ss]:</b> Joseph, perhaps this should be thought about some more.  A HUGE problem we currently have is membership buy-in by the community at large.  Where is it best to situate some committed activity to stimulate and maintain membership capacity building?  It seems fairly clear that pushing from the top (Directorate) doesn't have a positive result.</i>
</p>
<p><i><b>[jb]:</b> We have to create opportunities for people to join, to sign up. E.g., participating in the annual meeting is an opportunity to sign up. Fees for attending the annual meeting need to be set so that they include annual membership in the registration. We need to actively survey membership to identify needs and opportunities that DCMI could meet.</i>

<p><i><b>[mz]:</b> suggest to include the AB chairs and standing committee chairs, and maybe appointed one or two members.</i>
</p>
<p><i><b>[jb]:</b> Maybe this should be a committee of all the other committee chairs.</i>
