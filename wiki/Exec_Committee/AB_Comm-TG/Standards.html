<p>The UB shall seek the advice of the Advisory Board (AB) on:

<ol type="1">
    <li>all matters entailing significant changes to current DCMI policies on specifications;</li>
    <li>such other matters as the UB determines will benefit from wider input in order to avoid unintended technical or best practice consequences; and</li>
    <li>developing and executing, by systematic means, an environmental scan to determine current drivers and enablers of metadata innovation in the ecosystem in order to identify trends and to inform the UB focus and work agenda. </li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li> Advises the OC and Directorate on community-developed specifications, vocabularies, and best practices guidelines in support of resource description.
</li>
<li> Shall actively identify potential new specifications and vocabularies needed by the stakeholder community.
</li>
<li> Shall work with DCMI Communities and Task Groups, as well as appropriate DCMI members and stakeholder organizations to initiate and supervise the development of new specifications and vocabularies.
</li>
<li> May vote or comment in accordance with the majority opinion of the committee in the name of DCMI on all proposed specifications in support of resource descriptions.
</li>
<li> Shall promptly report all actions and comments to the OC; proposed actions and comments shall be reported to the OC in advance whenever possible.
</li>
</ul>

<i><b>(MZ)</b> Note the relation with Usage Board listed in the above section. What specific item(s) should be added to the Scope?</i>
</p>
<p><i><b>(JB)</b> Seems to me that the Usage Board and the Standards Committee should be the same, unless we are making a distinction between advising vs. executing. But the scope as stated above is what the Usage Board would do. We think there are a lot of unmet user needs such as a namespace for application profiles, developing the DCMI research agenda, etc.</i>
</p>
<p><i><b>(mz)</b> After our knowledge audit exercise we believe that there is a need for a committee to manage the community-generated products like application profiles, vocabularies, and best practices/guidelines.</i>
