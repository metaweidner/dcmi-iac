<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Oversight_Committee"> Oversight Committee </span>
</h1>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Current.29_Charter"> (Current) Charter </span>
</h2>
<p>The DCMI Board establishes an Oversight Committee that advises on operational, strategic and other issues and exercises voting privileges in the governance of DCMI. The Oversight Committee is comprised of: (1) Regional Members, (2) Independent Members (individuals appointed by the Board), and (3) Institutional Members. In all matters, the Oversight Committee establishes equitable procedures for its decision-making. While most activities in DCMI are consensus based, certain formal actions are subject to formal voting. The common rule for voting within DCMI is that proposals need more than 50% of assigned votes in favor and less than 25% of assigned votes against. Given the global nature of DCMI, where formal voting is required, electronic balloting is preferred.
</p>

</p>
