<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Advisory_Board"> Advisory Board </span>
</h1>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Current_Charter"> Current Charter </span>
</h2>
<p>The DCMI Advisory Board gives advice to the DCMI Managing Director on all technical and strategic issues that occur during the operation of the DCMI. The Advisory Board has a dual role in DCMI: an internal role to assist in and advise on the developments that take place within DCMI, and an external role to liaise with the stakeholder community and other global metadata initiatives.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Commitment_of_Board_Members"> Commitment of Board Members </span>
</h2>
<p>Members of the Advisory Board commit to the stated mission and principles of the DCMI. They must be able to assign appropriate resources to their duties, at least expressing their funded opinions on issues that are brought before the Board. Members are expected to be involved on a regular basis in discussions of the Advisory Board, either attending meetings or participating in other scheduled communications (e-mail, teleconferences, IRC) that are provided as alternatives to travel.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Appointment_of_Members"> Appointment of Members </span>
</h2>
<p>The Advisory Board will be comprised of:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Moderators of DCMI Communities
</li>
<li> Leaders of DCMI Task Groups
</li>
<li> Liaisons to other metadata activities
</li>
<li> Representatives of DCMI Members and other stakeholder organizations
</li>
<li> Invited experts appointed by the DCMI Managing Director
</li>
</ol>
<p>The DCMI Managing Director is ex-officio member of the Advisory Board, as is the chair of the Usage Board. The Advisory Board is chaired and convened by the DCMI Managing Director. One or more vice-chairs can be appointed as necessary.
</p>
<p>Advisory Board members serving as chairs of Communities or Task Groups remain on the Board during their terms of office as Chairs. All other Advisory Board members will be appointed for 3-year renewable terms. They may step down if their professional or personal circumstances so require.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Board_Roles"> Board Roles </span>
</h2>
<ol>
<li> Internal role: 
<ul>
<li> The Advisory Board is the primary source of expertise that can be drawn upon to lead DCMI activities and provide timely technical reviews of proposals that emerge from DCMI Communities and Task Groups.  
</li>
<li> It has an important role in reviewing charters and activities of DCMI Communities and Task Groups. This role puts specific emphasis on recognizing and signaling potential conflicts between activities, suggesting specific coordination between groups, and proposing specific contacts with individuals, groups or organization outside DCMI. 
</li>
<li> The Advisory Board advises the DCMI Managing Director on all technical and strategic deliverables and will maintain strong links with the Usage Board that is primarily responsible for semantic issues.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>External role
<ul><li> Advisory Board members are ambassadors of the DCMI. Some of the members maintain links between stakeholders in the DCMI community and DCMI; other members ensure liaisons with other metadata and content communities. Members who provide those links have a dual responsibility: to serve as a voice of their constituents to raise issues in the DCMI, and to assist in communicating the results of DCMI activities back to the community.
</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Board_Operations"> Board Operations </span>
</h2>
<p>The Advisory Board operates by mailing list (closed discussion group), face-to-face meetings at the annual DCMI Workshop/Conference and at additional meetings as might be deemed necessary by the DCMI Managing Director, telephone conferences and other forms of electronic communication.
</p>
<p>The Advisory Board has no formal voting procedures and operates on a principle of consultation, striving towards consensus. The DCMI Managing Director, if going against consensus of the Advisory Board, will do so with appropriate explanation and justification. In case of conflict the DCMI Oversight Committee can be asked to act as arbitrator.

<ul><li>
<i><b>[mz]:</b> Based on the discussions of the EC on Dec. 12, we renamed the "Standards" committee to "Specifications/Documentation" to reflect the activities surrounding application profiles and other activities outside the scope of the Usage Board (which would focus on formal standards maintenance and architectural direction).</i>
