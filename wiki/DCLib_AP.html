</h2>
<p>According to Singapore Framework a Dublin Core Application Profile is a document, or set of documents, which describes a metadata application. In doing so it does not only declare which terms from which namespaces are used in a particular application or project (Description Set Profile), but also defines the entities that are described with these elements (Domain Model) and the functionalities the application needs considering the requirements of the users (Functional Requirements). Additionally an application profile can define rules for the usage of terms (Usage Guidelines) and for their syntactical encoding (Encoding syntax guidelines ).
</p>
<p>Scope of this profile are the traditional librarian text materials - published or unpublished - like monographs, continuing publications (journals, yearbooks etc.), articles, preprints and postprints, as well as digitized or digital born versions of such material. We call this materials Bibliographic Text Resources, based on the following definitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Dublin Core Metadata Term specification defines Bibliographic Resource as "a book, article, or other documentary resource".
</li>
<li> DCMI Type vocabulary defines Text as "a resource consisting primarily of words for reading".
</li>
</ul>
<p>Objective of this Application Profile is a Dublin Core Application Profile that meets the requirements of libraries to describe these Bibliographic Text Resources by metadata and supports the publication of these metadata as linked data. 
</p>
<p>For the description of non-textual Bibliographic Resources in libraries (e.g. maps, images, films, etc.) the DC-Lib AP Task Group would develop further Application Profiles as far as these are required and no appropriate profiles exist. 
</p>
<p>The application profile proposes how to use DCMI Metadata Terms in libraries and library-related applications and projects. It is not so granular and complex as the DCMI/RDA Application Profiles but is nevertheless adequate for the description of all sorts of text publications in- and outside the library world. Therefore it has the use:
</p>
<ul>
<li> to support the publication of bibliographic metadata as linked data,
</li>
<li> to support the discovery of librarian resources in a semantic web, 
</li>
<li> to support simple creation of bibliographic metadata within a variety of systems,
</li>
<li> to combine bibliographic metadata with data from non-library communities using Dublin Core,
</li>
<li> to serve as an interchange format between various systems using different metadata standards/formats,
</li>
<li> to use for harvesting metadata from data sources within and outside of the library domain,
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way the profile will support the interoperability of Dublin Core based librarian and non-librarian metadata applications with rules and formats of the librarian world.
</p>
<p>In this regard the Profile will describe
</p>
<ul>
<li> Functional Requirements - the functions that the DC-Library Application Profile is designed to support 
</li>
<li> Entity-Relationship Model - the basic entities described by the application profile and their fundamental relationships 
</li>
<li> Description Set Profile - the terms with their templates and constraints that are required to fulfil the Functional Requirements 
</li>
<li> <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wiki/Properties2FRBR" title="Properties2FRBR">Properties2FRBR</a> - a mapping of the the properties of the Description Set Profile to FRBR-Entities. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>Target user groups of this profile are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Developers from the library and non-library world who want to build a simple metadata application for publications.
</li>
<li> Information providers who want to integrate bibliographic data into their metadata services.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This profile displaces the latest version of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2004/09/10/library-application-profile/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">DC-Library Application Profile</a>, published 10. September 2004. It is a product of the "DCMI Library Application Profile Task Group" that is responsible for further changes and maintenance. The profile will be submited for review to the Dublin Core Usage Board.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Functional_Requirements_of_DC-Lib_AP_for_Bibliographic_Text_Resources"> Functional Requirements of DC-Lib AP for Bibliographic Text Resources </span>
</h2>
<p>According to Singapore Framework the Functional Requirements describe the functions of an application with regard to the user needs. A similar statement we find at the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) which define the following four generic user tasks:
</p>
<ul>
<li> find an entity
</li>
<li> identify an entity
</li>
<li> select an entity
</li>
<li> acquire or obtain an entity
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these generic functionalities the DC Lib AP for Bibliographic Text Resources defines the following use cases as the specific functions this profile has to achieve:

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Entity-Relationship_Model_of_DC-Lib_AP_for_Bibliographic_Text_Resources"> Entity-Relationship Model of DC-Lib AP for Bibliographic Text Resources </span>
</h2>
<p>According to Singapore Framework an application profile must provide a domain model which defines the basic entities described by the profile and their fundamental relationships. Basis of this model are the Functional Requirements which in our case demand simplicity and feasibility on the one hand and linked data compatibility on the other. Furthermore the Functional Requirements demand a distinction between a publication and its single copies to describe availability and accessability of items in libraries. And finally metadata should be compliant with metadata of other library applications in the long run.
</p>
<p>For these reasons we developed a non-FRBR model, aligning on the model of the Functional Requirements of Bibliographic Records (FRBR) in some ways. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> FRBR distinguishes the following Group 1 entities: work, expression, manifestation and item. Our model distinguishes on this level only two entities: bibliographic text resource and item.
</li>
<li> FRBR distinguishes the following Group 2 entities: person and corporate body. Our model uses on this level only one entity: agent.
</li>
<li> FRBR distingiushes the followong Group 3 entities: concept, object, event und place. Our model uses on this level only one entity: concept
</li>
</ul>
<p>The entity-relationship model represents the relations between these entities:
</p>
<p><a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wiki/images/ClassesDCLAP_v1.jpg" class="image"><img alt="ClassesDCLAP v1.jpg" src="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wiki/images/ClassesDCLAP_v1.jpg" width="651" height="391"></a>
</p>
<p>where 
</p>
<ul><li> any Bibliographic Text Resource is an instance of the class bibliographicTextResource, which is a subclass of dcterms:bibliographicResource. (For further definition of bibliographicTextResource see LibClasses) A Bibliographic Text Resource 
<ul>
<li> has to be exemplified by one or more items 
</li>
<li> has to be created, contributed or published by one or more Agents 
</li>
<li> may have one or more Concepts as a subject 
</li>
<li> may have relations to one or more other Bibliographic Text Resources 
</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Instances of the class bibliographicTextResource shall be described using the terms of the DCLIB Bibliographic Text Resource Description Set Profile (see BibliographicResourceProperties).  
</p>
<ul><li> any Item is an instance of the class frbr:Item. An Item 
<ul>
<li> is an exemplar of one and only one Bibliographic Text Resource
</li>
<li> is available at one and only one Agent
</li>
<li> may be part of one or more Collections 
</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Instances of this class shall be described using the terms of the DCLIB Item Description Set Profile (see ItemProperties).
</p>
<ul><li> any Collection is an instance of dcmitype:Collection. For describing instances of this class we recommend to use terms of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/collection-application-profile/2007-03-09/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Dublin Core Collections Application Profile</a>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> any Agent is an instance of dcterms:Agent. For describing instances of this class we recommend to use terms of <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">FOAF vocabulary</a>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> any Concept is an instance of skos:concept. For describing instances of this class we recommend to use terms of  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">SKOS vocabulary</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>The model defines the following classes:
</p>
<ul>
<li> my:Collection rdf:type dcmitype:Collection .
</li>
<li> my:bibliographicTextResource rdfs:subClassOf dcterms:bibliographicResource .
</li>
<li> my:Item rdf:type frbr:Item .
</li>
<li> my:Agent rdf:type dcterms:Agent .
</li>
<li> my:Concept rdf:type skos:Concept .
