</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Abstract</i>: We present a 3-layer model for metadata of which the key component is CERIF in the middle, contextual, layer. CERIF forms the lowest, most detailed level of metadata information that is common across research objects such as datasets. Its richness of representation makes it a superset over many other metadata formats allowing their congruent generation from CERIF. CERIF is used in42 countries and is an EU Recommendation to member States.</blockquote>

</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Abstract</i>: Since 2007, EU Member States have been involved in creating an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe (INSPIRE), based on a legal and technical interoperability framework. This paper presents some of the lessons learnt during the implementation of this infrastructure (which started in 2009) and during work on data and service interoperability coordinated with European and international initiatives. We describe a number of critical interoperability issues affecting both scientific and government data and metadata, and propose how these problems could be effectively addressed by a closer collaboration of the government and scientific communities, by taking advantage of their complementary competencies, and by influencing the development and adoption of standards.</blockquote>

<ul><li>10:30-10:45 - Usage data for metadata properties to support open data registries and semantic wikis/Muriel Foulonneau, Sébastien Martin, Jacques Ducloy, Thierry Daunois and Slim Turki
</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Abstract</i>: Metadata and ontology repositories are critical to ensure the discovery of existing vocabularies and the reuse of vocabularies and/or individual properties. However, these infrastructures should take into consideration the decision making process and criteria for the selection of a vocabulary of individual concept or property. Usage data in particular are important and can reassure on the maintenance of the vocabulary by a third party. This data is to some extent available through dedicated tools, such as semantic search engines. We illustrate the need for integrating usage data in the vocabulary infrastructures in order to support the reusability of vocabularies and therefore interoperability and data usability in science. </blockquote>
<ul><li>10:45-11:00 - Provenance Central: More Mileage from Provenance Metadata/Bertram Ludaescher and Paolo Missier
</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Abstract</i>: We argue that to get the most value out of provenance it is critical to provide provenance
integration and analysis capabilities. For the former, we are developing D-PROV, an extension of
the W3C standard PROV that enriches the generic PROV model with important observables from
scientific workflow systems and other provenance-enabled systems such as R. For the latter, we
are developing PBase, a system prototype and associated language technologies to query and
analyze provenance. PBase will be part of the as DataONE data preservation infrastructure for
Earth Science Observation (www.dataone.org).
Our envisioned Provenance Central will be able to load and analyze provenance in order to
connect data through its provenance with other datasets, workflows, and ontologies, but also with
papers, scientific hypotheses, protocols, and users (i.e., authors and scientists). Discovering these
connections requires analytical techniques that have not yet been applied to provenance. For
example, since such provenance metadata will include, amongst other properties, data attribution
information, we propose a novel type of analysis, which involves mining provenance through the
entire repository, to elicit implicit social connections amongst the owners of the data. In
summary, Provenance Central will be a new way of making data and social connections explicit,
thus increasing data (re)usability in unprecedented ways.</blockquote>

</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Abstract:</i> Unique, persistent identifiers for vocabulary term concepts are critical for metadata (DC1, SKOS2,
etc). This comes as no surprise to followers of Linked Data3, for whom this first principle of the
semantic web is a sine qua non for automatic reasoning with web content. It is even more
important to metadata users who need a precise way to reference a particular concept when the
term may have more than one definition.
Such is the case for the SeaIce Metadictionary4, a crowd-sourced online dictionary of metadata
terms in which multiple competing definitions are expected to be common and to co-exist
indefinitely. Anyone can register and login in order to create new terms, edit their own terms,
and comment and vote on others’ terms. Typical use will be that someone, without logging in,
searches for and inserts terms they find into metadata that they’re creating to describe their own
research. If unsatisfied with the terms that they found – or didn’t find – they can login and take
action, which means anything from up- and down-voting terms, commenting on others’ terms, or
adding and editing their own terms. Typical users will be research scientists trying to describe
their datasets.</blockquote>

</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Abstract</i>: We must define a pragmatic separation of concerns between metadata activities and the typed information associated with Persistent Identifiers. This distinction is important for ongoing debates within respective communities as well as in the RDA working groups.
From a data archive’s viewpoint, a useful metaphor is that of the “black box” or “envelope”: Data management is increasingly done by machinery rather than human users. So the machinery must know what to do with the boxes that come in through various channels, but it cannot open them for various reasons. We propose that metadata is a concern that is – from this particular view of automated data management – located inside the black box. A metadata description may actually be a black box object that must be managed just like all the others. Still, some information must be written on the outside of the box to be interpreted by the machinery. This information may be a subset of metadata, but it may also contain additional information not interesting as domain metadata.</blockquote>

</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Abstract</i>: Metadata standards are important for normalizing descriptions of publications and research data and for information discovery and use. Large, complex metadata standards, however, can complicate the creation, sharing, and maintenance of metadata and incur high costs for metadata operations, especially in the domain of scientific data. One strategy to solve the problems of large, complex metadata standards is to break them into independent modules to allow for reuse of elements and maximal possibility of automation. To implement this strategy, we need a metadata infrastructure that contains elements, vocabularies, and other metadata artifacts and that is easy to use. This short paper describes the design approach to an ontology-enabled metadata schema generator as part of the metadata infrastructure.</blockquote>

<li>12:40-12:50 - RUresearch - Open Source Metadata Application Profile and Research Object Handling for Research Data/Grace Agnew and Mary Beth Weber
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<i>Abstract</i>: The Rutgers University Libraries have developed an open source workflow management system that includes a cataloging utility and a compound object handling system that enables the creation of metadata and intelligent object handling to fully support documenting and sharing research data. The cataloging system, which can be used independently and can work with any repository architecture, supports both MODS and Dublin Core metadata schemas. The MODS application profile includes an event-based subschema as a MODS extension schema, that can capture any useful event in the lifecycle of the data, from data capture, to data analysis, to data editing to data reuse. The application profile also includes elements for type of research, research methodology, type of data and type of subject, mapped to MODS and Dublin Core genre and subject elements. The data compound object supports documentation (lab notebooks, images, etc.) and instrumentation (data capture, data analysis, etc.). In addition to relating resources to each other using RDF, the resource handling also includes support for hierarchical file uploads, exactly as they are stored on the researcher’s computer or server. The the metadata and object handling will be presented through examples from the RUcore (Rutgers Community repository) research data portal, RURsearch, <a href="http://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/research/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/research/</a>
