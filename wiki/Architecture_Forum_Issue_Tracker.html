</h2>
<ol>
<li> Anyone wishing to create an issue, or comment on an issue, must first get a free GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com/plans" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/plans</a>
</li>
<li> Raise an issue here by pressing "New Issue": <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/issues" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/issues</a> 
</li>
<li> Every line in every file has a URI, so in an issue, one can reference a specific line number in a specific file as in: <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L108" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L108</a>
</li>
<li> One can also reference a specific version of a file: <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#mappings_schema.org.xml" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#mappings_schema.org.xml</a>
</li>
<li> One can insert a comment directly: <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#commitcomment-1089282" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#commitcomment-1089282</a>
</li>
<li> In creating issues, Corey followed Kirsten's pattern of using the current text of a particular triple as the issue's "title", and including some text &amp; a line number for the *first* line of the RDF-XML of that triple: <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L57" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L57</a>
</li>
<li> Currently users have to be logged in to comment. We *might* be able to change that, but may not want to. What we need to decide next is how these get "assigned" and eventually "resolved".
</li>
</ol>
