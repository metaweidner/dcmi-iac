<p>Present: Tom Baker, Mike Crandall, Mike Lauruhn, Debbie Maron, Stuart Sutton
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Technical:</b> 
</li></ul>
<p>Joseph has updated the competency index and the topical index and sent the files to Abi who was able to update the website competency index to the latest version. The name and description of the top level node needs editing (that can be done through the admin dashboard if someone wants to do so). She also fixed a couple of bugs in the Saved Sets plugin but unfortunately introduced some new bugs in the process, which she will address after getting back from travels. Stuart notes that about 58 records were missed because of change in topic index, will clean that up. Joseph is also working on setting up a dev instance of the RDF store so that when Marcia's group is ready to test the editing tools, they can test out authoring various records in a sandbox environment. Stuart will reschedule tech overview either next month or in a separate call.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Resource Collection:</b> 
</li></ul>
<p>Marcia and her RA have done a quick review of the site and documented their initial findings. Next step is to develop some test protocols for use with external reviewers. Mike C, Stuart and Marcia will discuss further this Friday. Once the dev sandbox for the editing tools is ready, that will be used for testing, so that the production site will not be impacted as the editing tools are evaluated.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Editorial Board:</b> 
</li></ul>
<p>Postponed last call, rescheduled for Friday. Filling in gaps in index, focusing on writing documentation for getting updates based on Github pull request, both technical and general public description. Stuart also working on documentation for the technical aspects of the project. 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Marketing and Community Building:</b> 
</li></ul>
<p>David has submitted a poster for DC2016 focused on the technical design of the LD4PE website. Mike L. notes that someone has posted comments on the Google doc related to provenance data, Tom will check on this.
