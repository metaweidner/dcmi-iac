</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Technical Work</b>:  Stuart and Joseph continue to make progress on the Editor for the triple store, and it is ready for testing.  Joseph is looking for people to validate the LRMI RDF syntax produced by the the editor (which includes many literals because of the lack of URIs in the LRMI vocabularies-- a future project for the LRMI task group). An autocomplete feature has been built into the editor to allow real-time lookup of prior entries, which should hopefully reduce duplication. Please try the <a href="http://54.175.178.152/rdf/lrmi/#/home" class="external text" rel="nofollow">editor</a><sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>, and send any feedback to Joseph. We agreed that Sean will work with Joseph and Stuart to review the editor, but others can also step in here and let Joseph know if there are areas of confusion.  A job description for the student helper to aid with the WordPress integration with the triple store has been created, and Mike will begin looking for candidates immediately.  Tom has submitted the request for a domain name to KNL for a permanent address for the WordPress site. David asked for feedback on the updated <a href="/images/6/61/Ld4peSystemArchitecture_v0.3.pdf" class="internal" title="Ld4peSystemArchitecture v0.3.pdf">architecture diagram</a><sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup>.
</li>
<li> <b>Resource Collection</b>: Sean Dolan has created a glossary of terms related to LD4PE and distributed through the listserv- please take a look and send feedback. Sean asked about including tools as resources, and we all agreed that is appropriate, but they should be classed as such so that we can differentiate them from other resource types. May need to work on type vocabulary for this.  Mike C will send an intro to content partners so Sean can discuss resources they might have that would contribute to the pool. Joseph will be taking a dump of the resource collection in the next couple weeks to start populating the triple store for testing.
</li>
<li> <b>Editorial Board</b>: Tom proposed a model for the editorial board on the listserv focused heavily on resource review.  After some discussion, we agreed that the primary function of the board should be the review and care of the Competency Index, with resource review a secondary function, primarily focused on selecting high value resources to support key areas of the index. We agreed that Sean should be a part of the board, which should have a small core, but bring subject matter experts in for short term advice on the Index or resource gaps. Sean should be the primary driver in identifying content gaps, with the Editorial Board helping to locate resources when appropriate. Tom will follow up with Sean to identify current gaps Sean has identified in the Index, and begin to assemble members for the board and set up a review schedule.  Joseph will send an ascii version of the current index for Tom to use in recruiting candidates (which might include some of our content partners).
</li>
<li> <b>Marketing/Community building</b>: Mike L. had to leave before we got to this item, but Debbie Maron and Mike L. have submitted a proposal for a workshop to LITA, and will make that available on the <a href="http://metaweidner.github.io/dcmi-iac/wikihttp://wiki.dublincore.org/Marketing_and_Community_Building" class="external text" rel="nofollow">wiki page</a> <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup>.  
</li>
<li> <b>Next Meeting</b>: Next meeting will be at 7:00 AM PDT on April 15.
