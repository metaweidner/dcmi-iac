- Check on action items:
  - Strategy to approach OCLC re purl.org (Stuart, Tom) [2015-11-20 Call][second-call]
  - Tom: nothing to be done immediately, but we keep it on the radar
  - Stuart: contacted Eric, conversations are going on in OCLC, presumably involving other parties who could be involved in maintaining the service
  - Github consolidation (Tom) [2015-11-20 Call][second-call]
    - Tom created two private repositories shared with Stuart for now to check permissions.
    - Will continue to move stuff over 
    - Restructuring (next couple of weeks)
    - Add all IAC members to <http://github.com/dcmi> (all) [2015-11-20 Call][second-call]
      - If anyone doesn't have access, please check with Tom

- W3C representation on task forces (Stuart)
  - Stuart: DCMI is W3C member, Tom is in the Advisory Committee
  - DCMI can sit on Task Groups, Working Groups and so on
  - W3C doesn't like people joining groups via DCMI if they work rather for another institution that could be W3C member directly.
  - Participants should be cautious to make sure that they act on behalf of DCMI
  - Maybe provide dublincore.org/net email addresses to participants.
  - DCMI brings the interests of cultural memory groups to the table
  - W3C opportunities for involvement: <http://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities>

- Malware issues (Tom, Jon)
  - no further complaints
  - no response regarding further details
  - ACTION: Tom sends another follow-up to NLK
  - Otherwise we don't see a reason or even potential for further action

- Mailinglist for the IAC (Kai, Tom)
  - ACTION: Tom contact Alex re. DC-TOOLS and DC-REVIEW lists to get them working reliably

- Action plan for the website (Kai)
  - There is a timeframe, latest July 2017!
  - Decision is to be made very soon: there will be a Wordpress website, based on the LD4PE wordpress installation
  - <http://dublincore.net/> is already Wordpress driven, Menus are broken
  - LD4PE goes live within a couple of weeks
  - Question: Should we go ahead with Wordpress or not?
  - Wordpress
    - advantages: easy to create and maintain content
    - disadvantages: long term preservation/migration of content
  - [Static Site Generators][static]
    - advantages: flexible and easy to preserve
    - disadvantages: requires significant development and coding/markup skills for maintenance

ACTION: Tom provide a list of URLs pointing to stuff on the site that shows the variety of content as well as indicating the important parts that have to be supported by future systems.

<https://staticsitegenerators.net/>

ACTION TO ALL: Pick items from Toms list and try to get them done in your favorite system, Wordpress or a static site generator. So we can compare and discuss.

For the last point, please review the minutes of our [2015-11-06 call][first-call].
We more or less agreed on investigating some static site generation
approach. To get this started, we have to decide on the next step, e.g.,
forming a task group or get some demonstrations or prototypes.
