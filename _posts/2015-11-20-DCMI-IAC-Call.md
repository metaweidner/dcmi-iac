- Inventory of infrastructural stuff: [DCMI Infrastructure Inventory][dcmi-infrastructure]
- Github advice
  - Dublin Core Handle: <http://github.com/dublincore>


Action Items
- Tom:
  - move everything fomr github.com/dublincore to github.com/dcmi
  - If possible, a note or readme is left in the account or in each repository (maybe also delete the existing repos and create a placeholder repo)
- All: send github account to Tom to be added to github.com/dcmi

Proposed solution: We only use <http://github.com/dcmi> which is an organizational account and also supports private repos if needed.

  - indispensable service used by many institutions
  - possible frozen PURL service with another layer of redirection
  - if OCLC is unwilling to maintain the service, a clear exit strategy would be helpful
  - better branding to make OCLC connection more clear might be beneficial

Action Items
Stuart & Tom: Develop strategy for approaching OCLC


- W3C representation on task forces
